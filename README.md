# pi-bike-sensor

## What I used to do this

* Raspberry Pi (I used zero W)
* A connection to a reed switch on your bike
  * Mine has a 3.5mm jack. I chopped up a spare usb to line in cable I had, and trimmed the wires
* A 1k resistor
* Jumper cables / some wires to connect the Pi to the sensor
* Solder / crimp cables (this is what I used to avoid a soldering iron)
